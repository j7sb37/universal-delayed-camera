**Delayed Camera – A Digital Mirror for Sports Analysis**

Delayed Camera works like a digital mirror: it displays the camera feed with a delay, allowing you to review your performance immediately after the action. This makes it an excellent tool for analyzing sports techniques and movements.

**1. Delayed Preview**

The app does not show the image in real-time, but after a set delay (e.g., 5 seconds). This allows you to perform a movement, turn toward the screen, and see your action exactly as it happened.

Example: In Judo, you can perform a throw and immediately check the screen to see if your grip and balance were correct.

**2. Smart Retrospective Recording**

The app records video retroactively. You can configure the recording to start, for example, 5 seconds before the moment currently shown on the screen. This ensures your entire performance is saved, even if you only hit the record button after seeing the result in the delayed view.

Example: If you want to analyze a Judo throwing sequence, you can start the recording after the throw is completed—and still capture the entire movement on video.

**3. Technical Features**

- Adjustable Resolution: 480p to 4K
- FPS Selection: 30 or 60 FPS
- Timestamp: Continuous date and time display on screen
- WebM Recording: Videos are saved directly to your computer in WebM format
